    <h1>Probing The Universe</h1>
    <h3><i>
     Study of the Sun, the planets and more distant celestial bodies is producing
      a wealth of new knowledge about our own planet Earth 
    </i></h3>

      <p>
        An exciting look at the surface of Venus, not visible to Earth-based optical telescopes because it is permanently cloud-shrouded,
        was provided last year by NASA's Pioneer Venus 1. The spacecraft's cloud-penetrating radar system showed a variety of terrain features, 
        including mountains taller than Earth's. Observing 10, one of the moons of the giant planet Jupiter, the Voyager 1 spacecraft photographed
        tremendous volcanic explosions which spewed matter a hundred miles above 10's surface. This marked the first identification of currently
        active volcanoes elsewhere in the solar system. Pioneer 11, Earth's first envoy to Saturn, discovered a hitherto unknown 11th Saturnian moon 
        and uncovered the existence of two additional rings in the planet's multiple ring system. These are a few of the great many scientifically 
        important findings made by NASA planetary spacecraft during 1979. It was a particularly active year for planetary investigation, with several 
        spacecraft simultaneously returning volumes of information about Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Another chapter in the fascinating study of 
        the solar system will be written this year in November -when Voyager 1 flies by Saturn to amplify earlier data about the ringed planet and its moons.

        By virtue of their incredible ability to send photos and data over hundreds of millions of miles, the robot planetary explorers have gripped 
        the world's imagination and have become the most publicly visible element of NASA's space science effort. Planetary investigation, however,
        is but one part of the comprehensive, four-pronged space science program, other elements of which include:
      </p>

    <li>
      <ul>
        <li>Astrophysics research, involvin observation of distant stars, galaxies
            and other celestial phenomena in a quest for understanding the size,
            scope and structure of the universe, its origin and evolution</li>
        <li>Solar terrestrial research, including study of the processes that generate
            energy in the Sun and transport it to Earth, and the interactions of that
            energy with Earth's environment.</li>
        <li>Life sciences research, aimed at understanding the origin and distribution of life in the universe; in
            addition, this area of effort takes advantage of the space environment to improve knowledge in medicine
            and biology, and seeks to develop means whereby humans may safely perform in space over long periods of
            time to carry out the extraterrestrial missions contemplated for the future.</li>
